            <p>Hip hop dance is a vibrant and energetic style that originated in the streets of New York City in the 1970s. It is a key element of hip hop culture, alongside rap (MCing), DJing, and graffiti art. Hip hop dance is known for its improvisational and competitive nature, often performed in battles or cyphers (circles of dancers).
                <p style="font-size:18px">Key Characteristics of Hip Hop Dance:</p>
                <li><b>Freestyle and Improvisation:</b>Hip hop dance heavily emphasizes freestyle, where dancers improvise their moves on the spot, allowing for personal expression and creativity.</li><br>
                <li><b>Breaking (Breakdancing):</b> Known for its acrobatic moves, power moves, footwork, freezes, and top rock. Breaking was one of the earliest forms of hip hop dance.</li><br>
                <li><b>Popping:</b> Characterized by quick, jerky movements (hits) to the rhythm of the music, creating a popping effect in the body.</li><br>
                <li><b>Locking:</b> Features distinctive stops, or "locks," within movements, combined with exaggerated and often comic gestures.</li><br>
                <li><b>Boogaloo:</b> A loose, fluid dance style that involves rolling the hips and knees, often with a smooth, wave-like motion.</li><br>
                <li><b>Krumping:</b> A highly energetic dance form that involves expressive, exaggerated movements and is often performed in battles.</li><br>
